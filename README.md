# RunLab

## Overview
The RunLab app provides running shoe reviews from our passionate users and general information such as price, manufacturer's website, and description so you can make a better decision next time your buying sneakers. At this time, only users with a login id will be able to leave reviews.

## MVP
- Full CRUD capacity backend (Ruby on Rails server and RESTful JSON endpoints).
- Full CRUD capacity frontend (8 rendered components in a well organized React file structure).
- Responsive design (mobile and desktop).
- User Sign Up/In Authentication.
- Deployment using Netlify (frontend) and Heroku (backend).

## Goals 
- Create an application that helps your average runner and newbies.
- Create a simple and minimalist app app that just does the job.
- Implement the lastest and most powerful technologies. 

## Libraries and Dependencies
- React: declarative, efficient and flexible Javascript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
- Ruby on Rails: Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted language for object-oriented programming. Rails is a webdevelopment framework written in Ruy language.
- React Boostrap: the most popular framework to build responsive websites. Every component in React B. has been built from scratch as a true React component.
- PRY: interactive shell for Ruby programming. Notable for its Smalltalk-inspired ability to start REPL within a running program. This let programmers debug and modify the current state of a system.
